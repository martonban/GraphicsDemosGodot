# Water Shader in 2D (Godot 3.5)
In this post I'll expplain how I did this 2D water shader. This is a tutorial based project.

<h2>UV Normalizeing and Texture</h2>
UV mapping is really important thing to do if we want to create responsible shaders. That's why we have to do the normalization. For example someone has a different ascect ratio monitor, if we not normalizing it, our shader will break. But in this case not just that. We use shaders to tile a texture. Why do we do this?<br>
Textures most of the time is just a simple image like this:
