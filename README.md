# Graphics Demos
This repository is contain all of my simpler "Technical Artist" projects in Godot. In the future I want to implement some advanced shading/ graphics techniques in godot before my own renderer.

# Beginnig
Before I statrted this journey I bought a Godot shader course. The folder called "ShaderCourse(GameDevTV)" contain all of the tutorial code.

# Practice
The folders called "2D Shaders Collection" and "3D Shaders Collection" is a scene where I did some more tutorial shaders and my own attempts.
